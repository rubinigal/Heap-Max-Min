Some important information:

1. In this folder, you will see a PNG file that contains the tests I performed with the numbers inside the "Array Data" file. 
   I executed all the options once and printed the array to the screen each time.

2. If you want to test with your own numbers, simply replace the numbers inside the "Array Data" file with your own.

3. The maximum number of values that the function can process is 127, which corresponds to a depth of 6 in the heap. 
   After that, any additional numbers will be ignored. If you wish to change this limit, you can modify the value of MAX_ARRAY_SIZE in the header file.
